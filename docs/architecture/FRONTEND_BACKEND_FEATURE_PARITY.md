# Frontend / Backend Feature Parity Report

_Last reviewed: 8 March 2026_

## Summary

This report compares the user-facing feature surface implemented in the backend with what is currently exposed through the frontend application.

## Overall Verdict

- The frontend is **not yet at full parity** with the backend.
- The previous draft undercounted the platform services; this revision now includes **IAM/Auth**, **Audit**, **Workflow**, **Notification**, and **File Service** alongside the main suites.
- **Cyber**, **Data**, and **Acta** have the strongest end-user workflow coverage among the domain suites.
- **Lex**, **Visus**, **Audit**, **File Service**, and parts of **AI Governance administration** still have substantial backend-ready capabilities that are not fully surfaced in the UI.
- Some items that initially looked missing are already wired in the frontend, especially **audit chain verification**, **notification read/delete actions**, and several **workflow task actions**.

## Method

This comparison is based on:

- backend route surfaces in:
	- `backend/internal/acta/handler/routes.go`
	- `backend/internal/lex/handler/routes.go`
	- `backend/internal/cyber/handler/routes.go`
	- `backend/internal/data/handler/routes.go`
	- `backend/internal/visus/handler/routes.go`
	- `backend/internal/aigovernance/handler/routes.go`
- frontend dashboard pages and API wiring under:
	- `frontend/src/app/(dashboard)/`
	- `frontend/src/lib/constants.ts`
	- `frontend/src/lib/enterprise/`
	- `frontend/src/lib/suite-api.ts`

This report evaluates **user-facing parity**, not internal-only backend behavior such as schedulers, consumers, background workers, seeders, or internal governance helpers.

## Reconciliation Notes

The earlier report missed several already-implemented frontend flows. Verified examples include:

- **Audit**: hash-chain verification is wired from the audit page via `POST /api/v1/audit/verify`.
- **Notifications**: save preferences, mark-as-read, mark-all-read, and delete are wired.
- **Workflow Engine**: claim, complete, reject, delegate, cancel, retry, suspend, and resume flows are wired in workflow/task UI.
- **Acta**: attendance, agenda, voting, minutes generation/update/submit/approve/publish, attachments, and action item actions are wired; it is not just list/create coverage.
- **AI Governance**: there is more than a single overview page; model detail, shadow comparison, drift, performance, prediction logs, explanations, promote, rollback, and feedback are all surfaced.

## Parity Matrix

| Suite | Backend Coverage | Frontend Coverage | Parity Status | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| IAM / Auth | High | High | Partial / Strong | Core auth, user, role, onboarding, MFA, and settings flows are surfaced; tenant admin, API keys, and advanced admin flows are not. |
| Audit | Medium | Low-Medium | Partial / Weak | Log listing and hash verification exist, but broader audit analytics/export/admin tooling are missing. |
| Workflow Engine | Medium | Medium | Partial | Instance and task operations are better covered than first assumed, but definition/template management is still absent. |
| Notification | Medium | Medium | Partial | Listing, unread count, preferences save, mark-read, mark-all-read, and delete exist; webhook/admin observability gaps remain. |
| File Service | Medium | Low | Partial / Weak | Listing and upload are present, but most lifecycle, download, metadata, and admin functions are missing. |
| Acta | High | High | Partial / Strong | Most major meeting-management flows are surfaced; some lifecycle and CRUD edges are still missing. |
| Lex | High | Medium | Partial / Weak | Backend analysis and compliance capabilities exceed current UI coverage. |
| Cyber | Very High | High | Partial / Strong | Many operational views exist, but not every backend action is surfaced. |
| Data | Very High | High | Partial / Strong | Large and broad frontend exists, but backend surface is larger still. |
| Visus | High | Medium | Partial / Weak | Read/report views exist, but authoring and executive endpoints are underrepresented. |
| AI Governance | High | Medium-High | Partial | Good monitoring and review coverage, incomplete administration coverage. |

## Suite-by-Suite Findings

### IAM / Auth

**Frontend surfaced**

- Login, logout, refresh, forgot/reset password, MFA setup/verify/disable
- Current-user profile update and password/session settings
- User management and role management pages under `frontend/src/app/(dashboard)/admin/users` and `frontend/src/app/(dashboard)/admin/roles`
- Onboarding registration, verification, wizard steps, and invitation accept/validate flows

**Not clearly surfaced in frontend**

- Tenant administration CRUD
- API key management lifecycle
- Invitation management outside onboarding-style flows
- Super-admin tenant provisioning / deprovisioning
- OAuth / PKCE login provider UX

**Assessment**

- IAM/Auth is **mostly covered for tenant end users and org admins**, but **platform-admin features are not at parity**.

### Audit

**Frontend surfaced**

- Audit log list with filters
- Detail panel from row selection
- Hash-chain verification action from the audit page

**Not clearly surfaced in frontend**

- Audit stats dashboard
- Dedicated log detail route / resource timeline view

- Partition management and other audit-admin operations

**Assessment**

- Audit is **better than a simple list-only view**, but still has **major analytics/admin gaps**.

### Workflow Engine

**Frontend surfaced**

- Workflow instance list and detail pages
- Task queue, task counts, claim flow, complete flow, reject flow, delegate flow
- Instance actions including cancel, retry, suspend, and resume

**Not clearly surfaced in frontend**

- Workflow definition CRUD / designer UI
- Workflow template management
- Manual workflow-instance creation / editing / deletion

- Notification preferences page with save
- Mark single notification read
- Mark all read
- Delete notification

**Not clearly surfaced in frontend**

- Webhook management

**Assessment**

- AI governance has **solid observability and review UX**, but **not full administrative parity**.

## Notes Against the Earlier Gap List

The following items from the supplemental gap list are already implemented in the frontend and should not be counted as missing:

- Audit hash-chain verification
- Notification preference save
- Notification mark-read / mark-all-read / delete
- Workflow task claim / complete / reject / delegate
- Workflow instance cancel / retry / suspend / resume
- Large portions of Acta meeting operations including attendance, attachments, agenda management, minutes lifecycle, compliance pages, and dashboard wiring
- AI Governance shadow comparison, drift monitoring, prediction log viewer, feedback, promote, and rollback

The following themes from the supplemental gap list are directionally correct and are now reflected in this report:

- Lex remains substantially under-surfaced
- Visus authoring/admin flows are still largely absent
- File service admin/detail flows are missing
- Audit analytics/export/admin tooling remains thin
- AI governance lacks full registry/version administration UI

## Biggest Missing Areas

### Highest frontend gaps

1. **Lex**
2. **Visus**
3. **File Service**
4. **Audit analytics / admin tooling**
5. **AI Governance administration**

### Best-covered suites

1. **Cyber**
2. **Acta**
3. **Data**
4. **Workflow task/instance operations**
5. **IAM/Auth core tenant flows**

## Final Verdict

- The frontend is **substantial and mature**, but it does **not implement every single backend feature or capability**.
- If the goal is true suite-by-suite parity, the highest-value backlog should focus on:
	- **Lex analysis and workflow operations**
	- **Visus authoring and executive endpoints**
	- **File service lifecycle and admin tooling**
	- **Audit analytics/export/admin tooling**
	- **AI governance admin flows**
	- **Remaining Acta and Cyber lifecycle edge actions**

## Suggested Next Step

The next useful artifact would be a **gap tracker** with columns like:

- backend capability
- frontend status
- priority
- recommended page / component
- API already available

That would turn this parity audit into an implementation backlog.
